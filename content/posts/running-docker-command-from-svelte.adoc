== What we're trying to do
I have a setup where different docker containers are used in conjunction to provide a single application. More specifically, a database, a sveltekit app, and (at the moment just one) container to run specific analyses. The idea is that the sveltekit app in container 1 triggers a script in container 2 to change data in the database in container 3.

== Directory structure
I created the following directory structure for the app:

[source]
----
docker-compose.yml
analysis/
  Dockerfile
  run_analysis.py
frontend/
  Dockerfile
  build/
  public/
  node_modules/
  src/
  ...
----

The `analysis` container only contains a `Dockerfile` and the specific command to run the analysis; the `frontend` container holds the svelte-kit code.

== Setting up the analysis container
The key in this solution is the `shell2http` script available from https://github.com/msoap/shell2http. This script enables you to attach a port on your machine to a specific script. For example, the command `shell2http /ps "ps aux"` will return the output of `ps aux` to your webbrowser if you go to http://localhost:8080/ps. 

Let's for example say that we have an ArangoDB collection in which we want to add a new key/value pair for the document with the id `1234`. The following simple python script does this.

{{< highlight docker "linenos=table" >}}
#!/usr/bin/env python
from arango import ArangoClient

client = ArangoClient(hosts="http://arangodb:8529")
db = client.db("oncoviz",username="<your_root_username>",password="<your_root_pwd>")
my_collection = db.collection("my_collection")
my_collection.update_match({'id':1234},{'newkey':'newvalue'})
{{< / highlight >}}

=== Testing shell2http
The regular way of running the script (let's name it `run_analysis.py`) would be `python ./run_analysis.py`. Therefore, we can make it available using `shell2http` with the following command: `shell2http /analysis "python run_analysis.py"`. This will return the following:

```
2022/07/03 11:45:03 register: /analysis (python2 run_analysis.py)
2022/07/03 11:45:03 register: / (index page)
2022/07/03 11:45:03 listen http://localhost:8080/
```

It can now be executed by going to http://localhost:8080/analysis.

=== Creating the Dockerfile
To get this to work from docker, we'll start from an ubuntu base, install go, shell2http and python, and copy our analysis script. The `CMD` needs to run the actual ssh2http command.

{{< highlight docker "linenos=table" >}}
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y

# install shell2http (common for all analysis containers)
# source: https://github.com/msoap/shell2http
RUN apt-get install -y ca-certificates
RUN apt-get install -y golang
RUN go install github.com/msoap/shell2http@latest
RUN cp /root/go/bin/shell2http /usr/local/bin

# specific for this container
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential curl python2
RUN curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py
RUN python2 get-pip.py
RUN pip install python-arango
WORKDIR /app
COPY run_analysis.py .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["/usr/local/bin/shell2http","/analyse","/usr/bin/python2 /app/run_analysis.py"]
{{< / highlight >}}

== Setting up the svelte-kit container
Similarly, we can set up the svelte-kit application. It doesn't matter here what that thing looks like, as long as we can go to the link show above somewhere (i.e. http://localhost:8080/analyse).

The code below is taken from the `src/routes/__layout.svelte` file. It uses sveltestrap to incorporate bootstrap into the application, and shows a navigation bar with three links, including `Analyse`. This one will go to the URL that we specified above and which triggers the shell2http script in the other container.

{{< highlight html "linenos=table" >}}
<script>
    import { Navbar, NavLink, NavbarBrand } from 'sveltestrap';
</script>

<Navbar color="light" light expand="md">
    <NavbarBrand href="/">My application</NavbarBrand>
    <NavLink href="/">Home</NavLink>
    <NavLink href="http://localhost:8080/analyse">Analyse</NavLink>
    <NavLink href="/overview">Overview</NavLink>
</Navbar>
{{< / highlight >}}

=== Creating the Dockerfile
The Dockerfile for this svelte-kit application is the following:
{{< highlight docker "linenos=table" >}}
FROM node:16
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
RUN apt-get install -y sshpass ssh
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build && npm prune --production
ENV PORT 3000
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node","build"]
{{< / highlight >}}

== Docker compose
Let's now combine everything into a single application, using docker compose. The `docker-compose.yml` file sets everything up:

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
services:
  analysis:
    build:
      context: analysis
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - app-network
  frontend:
    build:
      context: frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 5050:3000
    networks:
      - app-network
  arangodb:
    image: arangodb:3.9
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8529:8529
    environment:
      - ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=my_password
    networks:
      - app-network
    volumes:
      - arangodb_data_container:/var/lib/arangodb3
      - arangodb_apps_data_container:/var/lib/arangodb3-apps

networks:
  app-network:

volumes:
  arangodb_data_container:
  arangodb_apps_data_container:
{{< / highlight >}}

We can run everything with `docker-compose up --build`.

This `docker-compose.yml` file has 3 sections, one for each docker container.

For the `analysis` and `frontend` sections, the `build` part defines in which directory we can find the Dockerfile for the analysis container. We also have to expose the port 8080 in the `analysis` container, and forward the internal port 3000 to port 5050 for the `frontend` (i.e. svelte-kit) container. So if we go to http://localhost:5050, it will actually go to port 3000 _inside_ the container. Finally, we add the `analysis` and `frontend` container to the `app-network` network. This will allow us to refer to these containers from the other ones by their name.

We don't build the `arangodb` container ourselves, but use the one from dockerhub. In `volumes` we describe where on our local machine the data is stored so that it is preserved whenever we have to restart containers.

That's it.
