I'm trying out creating generative art using clojurescript and http://quil.info/[quil] (a clojurescript implementation of http://www.p5js.org[P5]).

== Routing and directory structure
The main issue to be solved was to get _routing_ working, so that I don't have to go into the source code to switch between visuals.

In https://jandot.github.io/posts/clojure-reframe-vis/[the previous post of visualisation in clojurescript] I created `rect` and `circle` in the `views.cljs` file. That's not how it should be done. The `views.cljs` file should contain the different pages instead.

{{< highlight clojure "linenos=table" >}}
(defn home-panel []
  (let [name (re-frame/subscribe [::subs/name])]
    [:div
     [:h1
      (str "Art generator")]
     [:p (str "Name: " @name)]]))

(defmethod routes/panels :home-panel [] [home-panel])

;; about

(defn about-panel []
  [:div
   [:h1 "This is the About Page."]])

(defmethod routes/panels :about-panel [] [about-panel])
{{< /highlight >}}

To add a tab that shows circles (using http://quil.info[quil]), we create a new file `generators/circles.cljs`:

{{< highlight clojure "linenos=table" >}}
(ns genart-clj.generators.circles
  (:require [quil.core :as q]
            [quil.middleware :as middleware]))

(defn sketch-setup []
    ;; set up here
)

(defn sketch-draw []
    ;; draw here
)

(defn create []
    (q/defsketch sketch
      :size [width height]
      :setup #'sketch-setup
      :draw #'sketch-draw
      :middleware [middleware/fun-mode]))
{{< /highlight >}}

In the `views.cljs` file we add `circles.cljs` to the `:require` and create a new view:

{{< highlight clojure "linenos=table" >}}
(ns genart-clj.views
  (:require
   [re-frame.core :as re-frame]
   [genart-clj.events :as events]
   [genart-clj.routes :as routes]
   [genart-clj.subs :as subs]
   [genart-clj.generators.circles :as circles]))

;; ...

(defn circles-panel []
  [:div
   [:h1 "Circles"]
   [:div#sketch]
   (circles/create)
   ])

(defmethod routes/panels :circles-panel [] [circles-panel])
{{< /highlight >}}

Unfortunately, this does _not_ always work. The problem seems to be that the `div` with id `sketch` is not mounted yet before the image is created and is attached to this (non-existing) div.

== Workaround
A possible workaround is to - instead of generating the image immediately - ask for the user to click a button first. When clicked, the image is created and mounted in that div.

{{< highlight clojure "linenos=table" >}}
;; ...

(defn generate-image [generator]
  (-> js/document
      (.querySelectorAll "p5Canvas")
      (map #(.remove %)))
  (.log js/console "hi")
  (generator))

(defn circles-panel []
  [:div
   [:h1 "Circles"]
   [:button {:class "btn btn-primary"
             :on-click #(generate-image circles/create)} "Generate..."]
   [:div#sketch]
   ])

;; ...
{{< /highlight >}}

The result before clicking:

After clicking:
