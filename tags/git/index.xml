      <description>Working on a project under git and pushing it to a central repository makes sure that you have history of the files preserved etc. Also: it enables experimentation. However, there are instances where things might get tricky. Case in point: hot fixes. When working on a feature branch and having to make a quick fix in the main branch, you would either stash all changes and make the fix, or commit everything that you already have even if it&amp;#8217;s not completed yet.</description>
