      <title>How to create Word file from asciidoc</title>

      <description>The easiest way to create Microsoft Word files (.docx) from asciidoc, is to generate the .html using asciidoctor and then using pandoc to convert that .html to .docx.
 In the code below, we avoid having to install pandoc by running it from a docker container.
 asciidoctor my_file.adoc docker run --rm --volume &#34;`pwd`:/data&#34; pandoc/core my_file.html -o my_file.docx   These can be combined in a Makefile, like so:
 my_file.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you want to add interactive material or custom visualisations to a site built with asciidoc. Luckily, it is possible to do so. An example can be found in my datavis technologies material here.
 The following steps are based on this blog post:https://dtang.dev/2020-01-25-adding-svelte-3-to-a-jekyll-site
   Step 1: Create a separate directory for the svelte-components, including rollup.config.js, etc.
  Step 2: Create a svelte-components/src directory with:

      <title>Vega-lite in svelte</title>

      <description>There are many ways of incorporating graphics and plots in svelte and svelte-kit applications. I can definitely recommend checking out this talk by Matthias Stahl, graphics lead at Der Spiegel in Germany. This talk goes specifically through creating animated plots in svelte at the 24:46 mark.
 So you can code your own SVG in svelte, use D3, P5, Three.js, etc. In the code below, we use vega-lite.
 What I wanted to achieve with this component, is that the user can choose which dimensions are plotted against each other in a scatterplot.</description>

      <title>Running Docker Command From Svelte</title>

      <description>What we&amp;#8217;re trying to do I have a setup where different docker containers are used in conjunction to provide a single application. More specifically, a database, a sveltekit app, and (at the moment just one) container to run specific analyses. The idea is that the sveltekit app in container 1 triggers a script in container 2 to change data in the database in container 3.
     Directory structure I created the following directory structure for the app:</description>

      <title>Clojurescript, re-frame and modular data visualisation</title>

      <description>One of the issues we still have is how to combine our custom data visualisations in multi-view dashboards with brushing/linking. We&amp;#8217;ll have a programmer work on this for the next two years, but as clojure is a bit of a hobby I&amp;#8217;d like to try that out as well. It appears that clojurescript re-frame fits the bill.

      <description>One of the courses I teach at KU Leuven is &#34;Management of Large-Scale Omics Datasets&#34;. It&amp;#8217;s basically a course focussing on NoSQL databases and mapreduce/spark. We go over document-oriented databases (i.c. mongodb), key-value stores, and graph databases (neo4j). The course also includes several exercise sessions where the students can practise getting information from these datastores. Question is: how to set all this up?
 Up to 2015, I applied for a teaching grant from Amazon AWS EC2 to run a server with all the necessary software and data installed.</description>

      <description>This is a reboot of the saaientist blog that I kept many years ago. As I said then: &#34;It started out long ago as a personal notebook to help me remind how to do things, but evolved to cover more opinionated posts as well.&#34; That blog was very useful, as it helped me to organise my thoughts, served as my personal labjournal/notebook, and helped me to come in contact with many interesting people.</description>
