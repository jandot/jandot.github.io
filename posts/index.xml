      <description>What we&amp;#8217;re trying to do I have a setup where different docker containers are used in conjunction to provide a single application. More specifically, a database, a sveltekit app, and (at the moment just one) container to run specific analyses. The idea is that the sveltekit app in container 1 triggers a script in container 2 to change data in the database in container 3.
     Directory structure I created the following directory structure for the app:</description>

      <description>One of the issues we still have is how to combine our custom data visualisations in multi-view dashboards with brushing/linking. We&amp;#8217;ll have a programmer work on this for the next two years, but as clojure is a bit of a hobby I&amp;#8217;d like to try that out as well. It appears that clojurescript re-frame fits the bill.

      <description>One of the courses I teach at KU Leuven is &#34;Management of Large-Scale Omics Datasets&#34;. It&amp;#8217;s basically a course focussing on NoSQL databases and mapreduce/spark. We go over document-oriented databases (i.c. mongodb), key-value stores, and graph databases (neo4j). The course also includes several exercise sessions where the students can practise getting information from these datastores. Question is: how to set all this up?
 Up to 2015, I applied for a teaching grant from Amazon AWS EC2 to run a server with all the necessary software and data installed.</description>

      <description>This is a reboot of the saaientist blog that I kept many years ago. As I said then: &#34;It started out long ago as a personal notebook to help me remind how to do things, but evolved to cover more opinionated posts as well.&#34; That blog was very useful, as it helped me to organise my thoughts, served as my personal labjournal/notebook, and helped me to come in contact with many interesting people.</description>
