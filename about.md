This is a reboot of the Saaientist blog at [http://saaientist.blogspot.com](http://saaientist.blogspot.com).

SaaienTist: a blog by me, for me and you. It started out long ago as a personal notebook to help me remind how to do things, but evolved to cover more opinionated posts as well. After a hiatus of almost 10 years, I resurrect it to help me organise my thoughts. It might or might not be useful to you. See the [reboot]({{site.baseurl}}/2019/03/reboot) post for some more background.

Why "Saaien tist"? Because it's pronounced as 'scientist', and means 'boring bloke' in Flemish.

BTW: "What's that image at the right", you ask? It's the evolution of air quality in the north of Spain since 1997. Will get you more information later.
